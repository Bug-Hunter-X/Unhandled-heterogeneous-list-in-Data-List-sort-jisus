```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNums = sort nums
  print sortedNums
```
This code uses the `sort` function from `Data.List` to sort a list of numbers.  However, it doesn't explicitly handle potential errors or edge cases.  For example, it implicitly assumes the input list only contains comparable elements. If the list contained elements of different types, the `sort` function would fail. A more robust solution would include type checking or error handling for unexpected input types.
